## Description
Machine Learning Project for Emotion Recognition with Python &amp; OpenCV.

##Aims & Objectives
The end goal of this project is to build a small web or mobile application to be able to detect various sentiments/emotions expressed by people in real-time

## Tools Used

In this project we'll be using **OpenCV**, as computer vision and machine learning library as well as the pre-trained deep learning model **DeepFace**

To get started:
- install anaconda and IDE - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- install **OpenCV**
```
pip install opencv-python
```
- install **DeepFace**
```
pip install deepface
```

### Enjoy!!!
